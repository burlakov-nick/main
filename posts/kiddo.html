        <p>Once upon a time, I was a little kid. I would rather forget those times, but decided it would be fun to show some childhood photos to have a good laugh.</p>

        <p>The most humiliating thing in childhood was having to wear tights, and people mistaking me for a girl.</p>

        <p>Little Nick hated semolina porridge and dentists the most. And nothing has changed since then.</p>

        <p>When I was 8, my mom got into baking. She was really good at it!</p>

        <p>I tried to learn to play guitar in school. I play terribly, but at least I look good in the photos.</p>

        <p>In the 7th grade, everyone was crazy about Eminem. I wasn't into the music, but I thought rappers looked really cool (never been more wrong!).</p>

        <p>During puberty, I was quite the rebel - I started and quit smoking, climbed onto roofs and sneaked around buildings, and even got into trouble with the police. But I don't have any other "criminal" photos left!</p>

        <p>I worked as a camp counselor for several years. It was fun working with kids, but nerve-wracking at times - I still sometimes get Vietnam-style flashbacks from those days.</p>
